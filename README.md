Evaluation of Classification Performance of User State-Detection on the Microsoft Band 2 Using Heart Rate, Galvanic Skin Response, Skin Temperature and Accelerometer Data


Excerpt..
The negative impacts of stress, which include an increased risk of heart disease and weakened immune system [1], come at a significant cost to physical health. The ability to be proactive in addressing these concerns is rooted in the detection and quantification of stress in our daily lives. Prior research has been conducted with respect to developing an effective non-invasive acute stress-detection system using physiological signals [2] [3] [4]. Research has shown that physiological signals such as heart rate (HR) and galvanic skin response (GSR) are the leading indicators for stress-detection [2] [3] [4]. Skin temperature and accelerometer data [5] [6] have also shown to be alternative indicators.
